①予算の壁 ②自治体の壁 ③物件の壁</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>保育士不足は保育士の処遇が低いことが要因です。 保育士給与は全国平均で月20.7万円。（出典： <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/1HwTytD\\\">http://bit.ly/1HwTytD</a> ）全産業平均と比較して、月額10万円程度低い。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>しかし、政府はこの保育士の処遇改善の予算をわずかしか取っていません。 月額1万円を上げるのに340億円、全産業平均値まで上げるのに3400億円を予算として積みませば、保育士処遇は改善し、開園スピードは大きく早まります</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>ちなみに「保育園落ちた日本死ね」の中で、「国会議員を半分にしろ」という提言（？）がありましたが、残念ながらそんなことをしてもスズメの涙のお金しか出てきません。（議員1人あたり給与と手当がざっくり4400万/年で、717人いる国会議員を半分の358人にすると、浮く税金は158億円。桁が違います。）</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>そうではなく、高齢者1000万人に3万円配ること（つまりは3600億円）をポンと決めちゃえるわけなので、出そうと思えば出せるのです。投票率が低いから、我々子育て世代の優先順位が、低いだけです。声をあげて、世論の波をつくるのです。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n/***/

美学者</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>「分析美学って何ですか」という質問への教科書的、かつ穏当な答え方は、「分析哲学の手法を用いて美学的な問題をあつかう学問ですよ」というものだろう。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>美学とは、〈美しいもの〉や〈面白いもの〉などを見てとるときに働く「感性」（注3）について考える学問である。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>「分析哲学」という言葉を、初期の言語分析に特化した時期の動向だけを指すものとして使う人もいるが、むしろ最近は、「初期の分析哲学の伝統を引き継ぎつつ行われている現代の哲学」という広い意味で用いられることが多い。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>分析美学の中では長らく「芸術を定義することができるか」とりわけ「芸術に必要十分条件を与えることができるか」ということが大きな問題となっていた</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>分析系哲学者たちは、「論争を通じての理論の前進」をとても重視する。もちろん、学問を評価するための評価軸は様々ありうるが、分析系の哲学はその中でも、「より良い論争を行うこと」にとりわけ高い優先順位を与えるのだ。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>分析美学は、「まずカントを読もう」「まずはプラトンを読もう」ところにスタートラインを置くのではなく、「何故これがアートなの？」「音楽作品って結局何なの？」「何故こんなに不道徳な作品が評価されてるの？」といった素朴な疑問から議論をスタートさせる。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n

href=\\\"http://www.komazaki.net/activity/2016/02/004774.html\\\">「保育園落ちた日本死ね」と叫んだ人に伝えたい、保育園が増えない理由</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>消費税増税の一部を使う、という財源のメドをつけて、昨年４月から「子ども子育て新制度」という待機児童問題にガチで取り組みますよ、という方策を打ち出しました。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>平成25年度あたりからグンと保育の拡大量が伸びました。しかし、認可保育所に申し込む人が増えたこともあり、待機児童は減らせず、むしろ若干増えている、という状況なのです。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>ここで疑問を持つ人も多いでしょう。認可保育所に申し込む人が多かろうが、それ以上に保育所つくれば良いじゃんか、と。その通りです。しかし、そんなに機動的に保育所をつくれない、３つの要因があります。 ①予算の壁 ②自治体の壁 ③物件の壁</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>保育士不足は保育士の処遇が低いことが要因です。 保育士給与は全国平均で月20.7万円。（出典： <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/1HwTytD\\\">http://bit.ly/1HwTytD</a> ）全産業平均と比較して、月額10万円程度低い。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>しかし、政府はこの保育士の処遇改善の予算をわずかしか取っていません。 月額1万円を上げるのに340億円、全産業平均値まで上げるのに3400億円を予算として積みませば、保育士処遇は改善し、開園スピードは大きく早まります</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>ちなみに「保育園落ちた日本死ね」の中で、「国会議員を半分にしろ」という提言（？）がありましたが、残念ながらそんなことをしてもスズメの涙のお金しか出てきません。（議員1人あたり給与と手当がざっくり4400万/年で、717人いる国会議員を半分の358人にすると、浮く税金は158億円。桁が違います。）</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>そうではなく、高齢者1000万人に3万円配ること（つまりは3600億円）をポンと決めちゃえるわけなので、出そうと思えば出せるのです。投票率が低いから、我々子育て世代の優先順位が、低いだけです。声をあげて、世論の波をつくるのです。</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n
